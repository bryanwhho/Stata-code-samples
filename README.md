Code samples from abortion-crime project

These are samples of code I wrote for a current project studying the effect of legalized abortion on crime in the 21st century. Please note that these code files while fully functional should not be taken as the final "official" versions.

-arrests.do: compiles, cleans and processes arrest data from the FBI Uniform Crime Report. Original data files were in ASCII-format, and imported using SPSS.

-tofips.ado: a simple program I wrote to automate a task I encountered repeatedly while processing data for this project. This program converts states names/name fragments to standardized FIPS codes. 

-dlab 3.1.do: creates the final dataset used for the abortion-crime analysis.

-dlabo_2016.do: conducts analyses for new paper
